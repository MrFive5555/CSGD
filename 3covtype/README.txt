----------
Note: ./data/covtype/covtype.libsvm.binary.scale is too large to be uploaded to GitHub, so we compress the first. Who wants to successfully run the codes should de-compress it.
For ./data/covtype/x.npy, which is even larger than 25M after compressing, so please contact liweiyu@mail.ustc.edu.cn for the data.
